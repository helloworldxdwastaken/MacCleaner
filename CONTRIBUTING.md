# Contributing to MacCleaner

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! MacCleaner is an open source macOS cleaner suite and every bug report, fix, and feature idea makes it better. It builds on the disk-space treemap visualizer from [TreeMap](https://github.com/Prithvi-Web/Treemap) by [@Prithvi-Web](https://github.com/Prithvi-Web) (used with permission — thank you!).

## Getting Started
 
**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 20+
- npm (comes with Node)
- macOS, Windows, or Linux
**Clone and run locally:**
 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/helloworldxdwastaken/MacCleaner.git
cd MacCleaner
npm install
npm run dev       # starts the server with auto-reload
```
 
Then open **http://127.0.0.1:4280** in your browser.
 
To run the desktop (Electron) version locally:
 
```bash
npm run app
```

## Project Structure
 
```
src/
  api/          Express routes (scan, files, system, insights, settings)
  services/     Core logic — DiskScanner, DuplicateFinder, Snapshots,
                CleanupRules, Scheduler, Settings, Storage, DiskUsage
  models/       Shared TypeScript interfaces
  utils/        formatBytes, squarified treemap, path sanitizer, glob matcher
  middleware/   errorHandler, rateLimiter, pathGuard
  index.ts      App entrypoint + graceful shutdown
 
electron/
  main.js       Desktop shell: window, tray, drag-drop, notifications, auto-update
  preload.js    Context-isolated bridge
 
public/
  index.html    Entire frontend — inline CSS + JS, zero external dependencies
 
scripts/
  gen-tray-icon.js  One-time tray icon generator
```
 
> **Frontend note:** The frontend is a single `index.html` with hand-coded Canvas 2D — no React, no D3, no Chart.js. Keep it that way. New UI changes should be vanilla JS/CSS inside that file.

## Development Workflow
 
| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start server with auto-reload (development) |
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript |
| `npm start` | Run compiled build |
| `npm run app` | Build + launch desktop app |
| `npm run dist:mac` | Build macOS `.dmg` (run on Mac) |
| `npm run dist:win` | Build Windows installer (run on Windows) |

## How to Contribute
 
### 1. Pick something to work on
 
- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/helloworldxdwastaken/MacCleaner/issues) tab for open bugs and feature requests
- Look for issues tagged `good first issue` if you're new
- If you want to work on something not listed, open an issue first so we can discuss it before you invest time
### 2. Create a branch
 
```bash
git checkout -b fix/duplicate-crash
# or
git checkout -b feature/dark-mode-toggle
```
 
Use a short, descriptive name prefixed with `fix/`, `feature/`, or `docs/`.
 
### 3. Make your changes
 
- Keep changes focused — one fix or feature per PR
- If you're touching the backend, make sure existing API endpoints still work
- If you're touching the frontend (`index.html`), test in both browser and desktop modes
- Add comments to non-obvious logic, especially in `services/` and `utils/`
### 4. Test manually
 
MacCleaner has no automated test suite yet (contributions welcome!). Before submitting:
 
- [ ] Run `npm run build` with no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Test your specific change end-to-end in the browser (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] If it touches the desktop app, test with `npm run app`
- [ ] Test on the OS your change targets (especially for trash/cleanup — behavior differs by OS)

## Submitting a Pull Request
 
1. Push your branch and open a PR against `main`
2. Fill in the PR description:
   - **What** changed
   - **Why** (link the issue if there is one)
   - **How to test** it manually
3. Screenshots or a short video are very welcome for UI changes
4. Keep PRs small — a 200-line change gets reviewed faster than a 2,000-line one
PRs are reviewed by the maintainer (@helloworldxdwastaken). Response time is typically within a few days. (The disk treemap engine comes from [@Prithvi-Web](https://github.com/Prithvi-Web) — see the credit above.)

## Reporting Bugs
 
Open an [Issue](https://github.com/helloworldxdwastaken/MacCleaner/issues/new) and include:
 
- **OS and version** (e.g. macOS 14.5, Windows 11)
- **MacCleaner version** (from the app or the Releases page)
- **What you did** — steps to reproduce
- **What you expected** vs **what actually happened**
- **Any error messages** from the console (open DevTools with `Cmd+Option+I` / `F12`)
> Safety note: never paste real file paths that reveal personal information in bug reports.
 
---
 
## Requesting Features
 
Open an [Issue](https://github.com/helloworldxdwastaken/MacCleaner/issues/new) with:
 
- The problem you're trying to solve (not just the solution you have in mind)
- How you'd expect it to work
- Whether you'd be willing to implement it yourself
Features that align with the core goal — **see what's eating your disk, safely clean it up, no tracking** — are most likely to be accepted.
 
---
 
## Code Style
 
- **TypeScript** for all backend code in `src/`
- **No new dependencies** without discussion — the frontend is intentionally zero-dependency, and the backend aims to stay lean
- Use `const` over `let` where possible
- Keep functions small and single-purpose
- Sanitize and validate all file paths — see `src/middleware/pathGuard.ts` for the existing pattern
- All file deletions must go through the OS trash — never `fs.unlink` or `fs.rm`
---
 
## Good First Issues
 
Not sure where to start? These areas are well-contained and beginner-friendly:
 
- **Typos or grammar** in the UI or README
- **`formatBytes` edge cases** — values under 1 KB, very large values
- **Accessibility** — keyboard navigation, ARIA labels in `index.html`
- **Error messages** — make them more descriptive when a scan fails
- **Cross-platform testing** — trying a feature on Windows or Linux and reporting back

Thanks again for contributing. Even a small fix or a well-written bug report is genuinely helpful. ⭐
